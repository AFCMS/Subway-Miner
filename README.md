# Subway Miner
AFCMS's submission to the Minetest Game Jam 2021

This game is both inspired from Subway-Surfers and Temple Run.

You drive the player between obstacles, trying to collect as many mese cristals as possible.

The game fully works with Minetest 5.4.1, but I recommand using 5.5-dev to avoid some graphical issues (which are not related to the game itself)
